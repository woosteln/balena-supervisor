        This allows a response to an input with dport=`supevisor api port` and
        is required when the host OS is doing stateful firewalling.

        This should not affect things when stateful firewalling is not in
        effect, as the standard OUTPUT chain policy is ACCEPT, so we're just
        being explicit about it.

      body: |
        We move the old sync.js script to tools/, and delete the now-broken
        sync-debug.js.

        We add a command `npm run sync`, which starts a livepush process
        with the supervisor on a device.

        We also remove the Makefile to go to a simpler build system, as long
        with

        the retry_docker_push.sh file. We remove the rest of the automation
        tools

        as they're no longer used and update the circle.yml file.


        We also remove debug builds, as these aren't needed moving forward, and
        were

        only to enable livepush builds.

    - subject: Add a noinit option to sync-debug
      hash: c47ef6d42abfe840cfa833a9f8f3789e142299e6
      body: |
        The noinit option will avoid doing a complete sync to the supervisor
        on startup. This is useful when there has only been code changes, and no
        modules etc have been added. It can be helpful when running on a network
        with no external internet access, as everything needed is already inside
        the container.

        To aid this we also move to yargs, rather than try to do all of the
        parsing ourselves.

        ConfigJson users now don't need to worry about initialization.
        It's done lazily on the first public method call.

        Implementation is also rewritten to follow async/await pattern.

      body: |
        Before this change a mixed device fleet with a subset using l4t would
        not be able to have containers which only run on the l4t based boards.
        We add a mock l4t version so the contracts will always be denied on
        non-l4t boards, but the release itself won't fail to validate.

        These contracts can specify an OS version and supervisor version that
        they require. If any of the containers in a release have requirements
        that are not met, the release is rejected, and the previous release
        continues to run.

      body: |
        This also required refactoring the request library to be generated with
        a promise, as we now no longer get the information synchronously.

        We also cache the release info, to avoid grabbing it again within the
        same runtime, which does not make sense.

    - subject: Unify API errors processing
      hash: 8b4c9837fa39bcb6642f7fd3208afa8d26b9af46
      body: >
        With this change, we define a custom error handler as express middleware

        which renders 503 error with JSON response that includes status and
        message

        fields.


        The handler also logs the error, so the stack can be inspected in
        supervisor

        logs. It's also a point where we can report the error to analytics
        services.


        This removes a bunch of error handlers written in every request handler

        function. Behaviour should remain unchanged except the fact that

        /healthy endpoint now returns 503 in case of failure instead of 500.

        If an error fires when writing to the cloud stream, it can stop any
        calling processes from completing. Given that a logging failure should
        not cause other processes to cancel, we catch and report the error but
        otherwise do nothing else.

      hash: ca9f8ffca1e306d4f4551a505b93b0bc7c679c81
      body: |
        The `createFromPath` method takes 3 parameters, while in a previous
        version it was only 2 (the new format splits the old format's first
        parameter into two, and keeping the last), before the refactor in commit
        23e564389daaa29feb231d1b091e07df82a7a300 (supervisor v9.18.4)
        The backup restoration call has not been updated and thus calls that
        function the old (wrong) way, resulting in failed restore, and volume
        management errors on a device that attempted a restore.

      hash: 4846acb25ebd5b1400e3a74bc3a3c607ae98be8e
      body: >
        With recent changes to local mode behavior, supervisor removes all
        engine objects

        that were not present before entering local mode.

        With this change, supervisor also detects its own resources and does not
        delete them

        if it was updated during local mode operations.

      body: |
        That way that this is performed is by first adding a depends_on entry
        for the target service if it appears in a network mode. Then when we
        generate the docker container for this service, we use the containerId
        of the target container and replace the network_mode with
        `container:<id>`.

        When comparing state, we check that the containerId still points to the
        contianerId of the target container, and in this way we ensure that
        when a network mode target container changes, we change the dependent
        container too.

    - subject: Don't attempt to cleanup any target state referenced volumes
      hash: a796777967facb96ade32f5a06e256b3b92d1e4b
      body: |
        The code before this change could potentially remove a volume which
        should not be removed if a container was deleted before the call that
        references said volume.

        To avoid this, we additionally filter the list of volumes to cleanup by
        any that are referenced in the target state. This means that cleanup
        will never remove it, as long as it's still supposed to be there,
        regardless of if a container references it or not.

        fix: When reporting initial config, avoid creating a "VPN enabled"
        unnecessary override
      hash: 743c8406c973af7ef85ff31ea8bb0bc99d4592fb
      body: >
        Since we were comparing the VPN's value before adding the explicit
        "true", there were cases

        were the VPN is off, and therefore "value" didn't match the default, so
        the supervisor would

        create a device specific SUPERVISOR_VPN_CONTROL = true, which is
        unnecessary and causes issues if

        users don't expect this and move the device to an app that has VPN
        disabled. The correct behavior

        is to compare "varValue" and only create a device config var if this
        value differs from the default.


        (This was the behavior before the TS conversion in
        01ed7bb103b4df8fb0679cf858220db42d4a0b92 )

        Changes in the node engine related to streams would cause the gzip
        streams flush function to be called at the wrong times. The sinon fake
        timers were also interacting with this.

        We use setImmediate to call the flush function, and remove sinon timers
        for the logging tests.

        port into consideration. This change makes it so that every host port
        per container port is considered.

        twice, which would cause the supervisor to think that there is a
        configuration mismatch.

        the api to reject the update unecessarily.

        We then use this value to calculate from which point in time to start
        reporting logs from the container. If this is the first time we've seen
        a container, we get all logs, and for every log reported we save the
        timestamp. If it is not the first time we've seen a container, we
        request all logs since the last reported time, ensuring no interruption
        of service.

        Add a random jitter to target state polls, and a config var to ignore
        update notifications and not poll immediately after startup
      hash: 8f07bf62de4a509ac74380af8be42b2acf3c1b76
      body: >
        This commit does two related things:


        * We make the poll interval a random time between 0.5 and 1.5 times the
        configured interval.

        * We introduce the BALENA_SUPERVISOR_INSTANT_UPDATE_TRIGGER
        configuration variable, that defaults to true. If this variable is set

        to false, then calls to /v1/update are ignored, and on startup the
        supervisor waits for a poll interval before getting the target state.


        This will help especially on cases where there's a large number of
        devices on a single network. By disabling instant updates and setting a
        large

        poll interval, we can now achieve a sitation where not all devices apply
        an update at the same time, which can help avoid

        overwhelming the network.

        When comparing a stopped container after a start request, the container

        were already filtering this value out of the current state, but
        neglected to do so for the target state. This change now ensures we
        remove it from both alias lists if it exists.

      body: >
        In an edge case observed in the field, a supervisor's database held two
        applications

        because the device had been moved and the update lock was set in the old
        app. This causes

        the updated supervisor to be unable to start, logging "No compatible
        releases found in API",

        because it can't fetch the release for the app it was moved from.


        This commit changes the migration code to iterate through all apps, and
        remove any for which

        we can't get a release.

        fix: When pinning a preloaded device, ensure the pinning is done when
        retrying after a failure
      hash: 22a5b331969af7e8f84bc8b5054ff80ff6c33dad
      body: >
        Without this patch, if for some reason device pinning fails (e.g.
        connectivity goes down) or anything

        interrupts the initialization after provisioning completes but before
        pinning is completed, after a retry

        the supervisor would just skip the pinning code, leaving the device
        unpinned. This patch ensures that the

        pinning procedure is run even if the device was already provisioned (as
        long as the pinning flag has been set,

        of course). This matches the behavior that the CoffeeScript code had
        from before the TypeScript conversion.

      body: |
        In the case of an airgapped supervisor, with a target state that
        requests the vpn be enabled, the supervisor will constantly loop on
        trying to set the vpn to on. Unfortunately the vpn requires an internet
        connection to be configured, so it will never be turned on.

        We add the concept of no-ops to the device-config state change steps,
        and don't end the state engine transition while these are present
        (similar to how image pulls are implemented).

        migration which will look explcitily for the failing value and switch it

    - subject: Allow newlines to be part of environment variables
      hash: 49dbaaba123b6f99f59b89e5ac0eae322949b4b2
      body: |
        We were not allowing newlines previously by virtue of the regex not
        allowing them. The docker daemon and supervisor handling code both
        support them, so we allow them in the parsing code too.

    - subject: Make sure to correctly convert config emit events after validation
      hash: 3d6dc88eb0c77d4bdeec93645d01d730c54e87d7
      body: |
        We were validating the input configuration values by coercing them to
        the correct type, and then using the initial value to be saved (which
        currently is always converted to a string).

        We now use the coerced value as the actual value we will store, and more
        importantly emit. This means that the config.on('change' ...) calls will
        always be properly typed, which before this change was not a guarantee
        that we could make.

      hash: f3264862ca73e9b059da7fa7ce19aa67bfb9c296
      body: |
        Adjacent ports are always grouped together by docker when reporting the
        container state (from an inspect), so adjacent ports defined in the
        compose file would not match as they would not have been normalized.

        We make sure to always normalize the input port configuration, so that
        it will match the docker output (if it should).

        We also don't sort in the fromComposePorts function anymore as that is
        handled by the normalize function.

      hash: e9b51bbcd741fd65851190e73428d00ab18f7443
      body: |
        In the original implementation it was possible that the delete did not
        wait for the kill step to be finished, so it would not be deleted.

        We seperate this process into two steps, to allow for the container to
        have stopped before proceeding.

        Docker always returns ports in ascending order, so if they aren't
        specified like that in the compose, a restart loop would occur. This
        patch changes the port maps to be stored in ascending order, based on
        an alphabetical sort of the internalStart port (not taking into account
        the protocol). This is the same as how Docker returns them, so they will
        match, regardless of input form.

        Fix a race condition that could cause an unnecessary restart of a
        service immediately after download
      hash: 42737cb9e96b889d0fdfd48926778a38566d927b
      body: >
        Up to now, there was a slim but non-zero chance that an image would be
        downloaded between the call to `@getTarget` inside deviceState

        (which gets the target state and creates Service objects using
        information from available images), and the call to

        `@images.getAvailable` in ApplicationManager (which is used to determine
        whether we should keep waiting for a download or start the

        service). If this race condition happened, then the ApplicationManager
        would infer that a service was ready to be started (because

        the image appears as available), but would have incomplete information
        about the service because the image wasn't available when

        the Service object was created. The result would be that the service
        would be started, and then immediately on the next applyTarget

        the ApplicationManager would try to kill it and restart it to update it
        with the complete information from the image.


        This patch changes this behavior by ensuring that all of the additional
        information about the current state, which includes available images,

        is gathered *before* building the current and target states that we
        compare. This means that if the image is downloaded after the call to
        getAvailable, the Service might be constructed with all the information
        about the image, but it won't be started until the next pass, because
        ApplicationManager will treat it as still downloading.
